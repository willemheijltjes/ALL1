We thank the reviewers for their effort and answer them in reverse
order.

Review 3:
=========

We agree with everything said in this review.


Review 2:
=========

The reviewer suggest to give a better overview of our results in the
introduction and also include a conclusion. We are happy to do so in
the final version of the paper.


Review 1:
=========

The reviewer has several complaints that we all address below.

1) The reviewer thinks that witness nets are not very interesting but
unification nets are, thus the focus in the paper is unbalanced.

We disagree. Witness nets are essential for developping unification
nets. the section on unification nets is so short because it builds on
the theory of witness nets that had to be developped before.

1') witness nets are straightforward extension of usual proof nets.

It only looks that way for you because we did an excellent job
presenting them. It took us hard work to simplify the presentation in
such a way that it looks straightforward. If it was that easy as you
think, then why took it 30 years for someone to come up with the idea?

2) Comparison to multi-focusing.

We are well aware of the work on multi-focusing and its relation to
expansion trees. First, observe that that work is about classical
logic and we are here dealing with linear logic, which is a different
world. And second, we do explain the relation to expansion trees in
section 1.2. Whether we can obtain a notion of focusing such that
which identifies the same proofs as our proof nets is a question for
future research, and you cannot expect an answer to that in this
paper.

3) Presentation.
